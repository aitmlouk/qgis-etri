Installation
------------
1) Unzip the archive in ~/.qgis/python/plugins (or the corresponding
   folder on Windows)
2) Start Quantum GIS
3) Go to Plugins -> Manage Plugins
4) Check the Electre Tri plugin
5) After this step an icon should appear in the plugin bar.
   To use it click on the icon and the ELECTRE TRI window should
   appear...

Usage
-----
1. When you start the plugin, a window with several tabs will be displayed.
The first thing to do is to choose the vector layer containing the actions
evaluated on the different criteria of the problem. This is done by
selecting the corresponding entry in the list box and then by clicking on
the load layer button.
2. After loading the layer, the different attributes of the layer will be
displayed in the criteria tab. Deselect attributes that are not criteria
of the model. For the criteria of the problem, you can change the weights
and the direction (if its a criterion to maximize or to minimize).
3. Once the criteria parameters defined, you can define the profile and
thresholds of the ELECTRE TRI model in the second tab.
4. Finally choose a cut level in the box on the right and then you can
generate the decision map by clicking on the corresponding button.
